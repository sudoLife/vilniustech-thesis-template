	abstract = {The evaluation of object detection models is usually performed by optimizing a single metric, e.g. {mAP}, on a fixed set of datasets, e.g. Microsoft {COCO} and Pascal {VOC}. Due to image retrieval and annotation costs, these datasets consist largely of images found on the web and do not represent many real-life domains that are being modelled in practice, e.g. satellite, microscopic and gaming, making it difficult to assert the degree of generalization learned by the model. We introduce the Roboflow-100 ({RF}100) consisting of 100 datasets, 7 imagery domains, 224,714 images, and 805 class labels with over 11,170 labelling hours. We derived {RF}100 from over 90,000 public datasets, 60 million public images that are actively being assembled and labelled by computer vision practitioners in the open on the web application Roboflow Universe. By releasing {RF}100, we aim to provide a semantically diverse, multi-domain benchmark of datasets to help researchers test their model's generalizability with real-life data. {RF}100 download and benchmark replication are available on {GitHub}.},
